#  Offline Live Activity demo

## [riff-tech.com](https://riff-tech.com)

This project supports a series of blog posts over at [Riff](https://riff-tech.com/blog).

## Offline?

Yes, meaning we have a Live Activity that animates as a task progresses, providing the user with useful and a "live" status, but does not implement remote push notifications to update the UI.  Some apps that have a scheduled activity with a predetermined "start" and "end" date might find this useful.

## It's a demo, not a complete project

This project is intended to demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of Live Activities, and therefore WidgetKit extensions in general.

We cover key areas:

- Composing a Live Activity
- Support for Smart Stack on watchOS
- URL schemes
- Shared app space using app groups
- Translucent, dynamic backgrounds for a Live Activity
- Troubleshooting the Preview Canvas for widgets
- Background tasks
- Remote images in widgets
- Much more
